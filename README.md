# Week 7 - Manipulation of Strings, Factors, and Datetimes

## Description and Topics

Numeric values are not the only type of data that we must learn to manipulate. Data is often presented as strings, factors, or datetimes. Each of these data types can be manipulated in different ways. Topics covered will include:

-   Understanding differences between strings and factors
-   String manipulation utilizing the `stringr` package and string matching concepts utilizing regex
-   Using `forcats` for factor manipulation
-   Using `lubridate` to manipulate dates
